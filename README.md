Run Sargon 1978 Standalone
==========================

(See my much more polished retro-sargon repository which generates the
Z80 Sargon source code this project tries to get running standalone).

A little project that started out as an attempt to help Has W Kramer
get sargon-z80.asm assembled and working on his Microprofessor Z80 computer
and then morphed into me trying to get sargon-z80.asm running as an
emulated CP/M program, hopefully with ascii-art graphics soon.
